# Algorithm Checkpoint Submission

This project contains solutions to the two algorithm problems given at the checkpoint. The problems are solved using arrays, procedures, functions, nested loops, and different types of parameter passing.

## Problem 1: Sum of Distinct Elements

**Description:** 
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements (those that appear in only one of the sets).

- **File:** `problem1_sum_of_distinct.algo`
- **Tools used:** Arrays, nested loops, conditionals
- **Expected Output:** `13` (based on example sets)

## Problem 2: Dot Product & Orthogonality Check

### Part A: Procedure Version

1. **File:** `dot_product_procedure.algo` 
   - A procedure that calculates the dot product using pass-by-reference.

2. **File:** `check_orthogonality_procedure.algo` 
   - Calls the `dot_product` procedure and checks if vectors are orthogonal (dot product = 0).

### Part B: Function Version

1. **File:** `dot_product_function.algo` 
   - A function that returns the dot product result.

2. **File:** `check_orthogonality_function.algo` 
   - Calls the `dot_product` function and checks if vectors are orthogonal.

## Features Used

- Arrays 
- Nested loops 
- Procedures & Functions 
- Parameter passing by value and by reference 
- Clear comments & structure
